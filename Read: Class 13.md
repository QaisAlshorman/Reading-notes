# Readings: Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry
## Consider the history:[ That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

## What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.

## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.

### When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters
### Why do diverse companies perform better?
"Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."

### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
